**"This commit includes the index.html file along with the accompanying style.css and script.js files for a YouTube clone project. The project features a simple, responsive layout that mimics the YouTube interface, including a header, sidebar, and video grid. The index.html file serves as the main entry point, while the style.css file provides styling to ensure the layout is visually appealing and responsive across various devices. The script.js file adds interactivity by fetching video data from a mock API and dynamically populating the video grid. This setup is designed to demonstrate basic web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration, and provides a foundation for further enhancements and features."**
